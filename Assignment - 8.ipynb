    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the \n",
    "program. When an exceptional situation or error is encountered, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and \n",
    "handled by the programmer to prevent the program from crashing. Exceptions allow you to gracefully handle errors and \n",
    "respond to them in a structured way, rather than letting the program terminate unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are objects that represent errors or exceptional situations in Python. They typically include information \n",
    "about the type of error and the context in which it occurred. You can raise exceptions explicitly in your code or handle \n",
    "exceptions that are raised by Python or external libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of built-in exceptions in Python include:- \n",
    "\n",
    "1. ZeroDivisionError: Raised when trying to divide by zero.\n",
    "2. TypeError: Raised when an operation is performed on an object of inappropriate type.\n",
    "3. ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct type but with an inappropriate value.\n",
    "4. FileNotFoundError: Raised when an attempt to open a file that doesn't exist is made.\n",
    "5. IndexError: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range in a sequence (e.g., a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are different from exceptions. They occur when there is a problem with the structure \n",
    "of your code,  such as a typo, missing or incorrect indentation, or using a reserved keyword incorrectly. Syntax errors \n",
    "prevent the program from running at all because they violate the rules of the Python language, making it impossible for \n",
    "Python to understand and execute the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cause:- Exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution due to invalid input, external factors, or \n",
    "other issues.Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program starts running and are caused by \n",
    "violations of the language's syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When They Occur:- Exceptions occur during the execution of the program and can be caused by a wide range of factors.\n",
    "Syntax errors are identified by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling:- Exceptions can be caught and handled using try and except blocks, allowing you to respond to errors and \n",
    "continue program execution.Syntax errors must be fixed in the code before the program can be run successfully. \n",
